" do it in this file (/etc/vim/vimrc), since debian.vim will be overwritten
" everytime an upgrade of the vim packages is performed.  It is recommended to
" make changes after sourcing debian.vim since it alters the value of the
" 'compatible' option.

" This line should not be removed as it ensures that various options are
" properly set to work with the Vim-related packages available in Debian.
runtime! debian.vim

" Uncomment the next line to make Vim more Vi-compatible
" NOTE: debian.vim sets 'nocompatible'.  Setting 'compatible' changes numerous
" options, so any other options should be set AFTER setting 'compatible'.
"set compatible

" Vim5 and later versions support syntax highlighting. Uncommenting the
" following enables syntax highlighting by default.
if has("syntax")
  syntax on
endif

" If using a dark background within the editing area and syntax highlighting
" turn on this option as well
"set background=dark

" Uncomment the following to have Vim jump to the last position when
" reopening a file
"if has("autocmd")
"  au BufReadPost * if line("'\"") > 1 && line("'\"") <= line("$") | exe "normal! g'\"" | endif
"endif

" Uncomment the following to have Vim load indentation rules and plugins
" according to the detected filetype.
"if has("autocmd")

" The following are commented out as they cause vim to behave a lot
" differently from regular Vi. They are highly recommended though.
"set showcmd		" Show (partial) command in status line.
"set showmatch		" Show matching brackets.
"set ignorecase		" Do case insensitive matching
"set smartcase		" Do smart case matching
"set incsearch		" Incremental search
"set autowrite		" Automatically save before commands like :next and :make
"set hidden             " Hide buffers when they are abandoned
"set mouse=a		" Enable mouse usage (all modes)

"3、设置Windows风格的C/C++自动缩进（添加以下set语句到vimrc中）
"1）设置（软）制表符宽度为4：
"set tabstop=4
"set softtabstop=4
"2）设置缩进的空格数为4
set shiftwidth=4
"3）设置自动缩进：即每行的缩进值与上一行相等；使用 noautoindent 取消设置：
set autoindent
"4）设置使用 C/C++ 语言的自动缩进方式：
set cindent
"5）设置C/C++语言的具体缩进方式（以我的windows风格为例）：
set cinoptions={0,1s,t0,n-2,p2s,(03s,=.5s,>1s,=1s,:1s
"6）如果想在左侧显示文本的行号，可以用以下语句：
set nu
"7）设置tab为四个空格
set ts=2  "(注：ts是tabstop的缩写，设TAB宽4个空格)
" 缩进用空格代替tab
set expandtab
set cursorline
set encoding=utf8 fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,cp936
